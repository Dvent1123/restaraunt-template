# Restaurant Website

This is a live site for a local restaurant that I created for them.
They did not have a website before so I made it from scratch. It is
a small business so I hosted it on Netlify since it is a static page.
I used Netlify functions to proxy an Express server to be able to reach
the Yelp API.
